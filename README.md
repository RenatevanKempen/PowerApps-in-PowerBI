# powerApps in Power BI 

Hello to you all!

My name is Renate van Kempen and in this repo you will find all kind of examples of the use of PowerApps in Power BI. 

## Why should I use PowerApps in Power BI? 
If you are a data professional and enjoy building Power BI dashboards, you might want to add some interactive possibilities.
For this reason you can add PowerApps in Power BI. 

Allow me to give you some reasons why PowerApps can be of added value: 
- PowerApps can add interactive possibilities to your dashboards, like adjusting data
- You can use PowerApps for review steps if you want your budget or forecast to be reviewed by different persons

.... and much much more

### Costs
Please note that PowerApps is part of the office365 license, but it is not free of charge if you want to use some premium connectors, sucht as SQL. 
There are several license plans, check out the [Microsoft site](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/) for more information. 
And in this [blog](https://www.cloudigy.nl/office-365/powerapps/licentiemodel-powerapps/) (in Dutch) you can read about the differences between the plans.
